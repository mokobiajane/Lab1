## 1. Introduction

This project performs BMP image processing using parallel computing in C++. It handles:

- Grayscale conversion
- Image rotation (clockwise and counterclockwise)
- Gaussian blur filtering

## 3. Features Implemented

- âœ… **Grayscale conversion** from 24-bit RGB to 8-bit grayscale
- âœ… **Clockwise rotation** (90Â°)
- âœ… **Counterclockwise rotation** (90Â°)
- âœ… **5x5 Gaussian blur** smoothing filter
- âœ… **Multithreaded execution** using `std::thread`
- âœ… **BMP file I/O support**

---

## 4. Parallelism

A custom `parallel_for` template distributes work across multiple CPU threads for the following operations:

- Grayscale conversion
- Rotation (clockwise & counterclockwise)
- Gaussian filtering

Threads are automatically scaled based on `std::thread::hardware_concurrency()`.

---

## 5. Memory and Performance

Memory usage is estimated for image buffers. Timings for each step are measured using `std::chrono`. Example output:

```text
Grayscale conversion took 27 ms
Clockwise rotation took 23 ms
Gaussian filtering took 31 ms
```

---

## 6. Code Documentation

Each function is documented using [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/manual/docblocks.html) style:

```cpp
/**
 * @brief Converts a BMP image to grayscale.
 * @param file_path Path to input BMP.
 * @param width Reference to output width.
 * @param height Reference to output height.
 * @return Pointer to grayscale image buffer.
 */
unsigned char* load_bmp(const char* file_path, int& width, int& height);
```

To generate documentation:

```bash
doxygen docs/Doxyfile
xdg-open docs/html/index.html
```

It will generate output in `docs/html/index.html`.

---

## 7. Doxygen Setup

The `Doxyfile` has the following key settings:

```ini
PROJECT_NAME = "Parallel BMP Processor"
INPUT = src include report.md
GENERATE_LATEX = NO
RECURSIVE = YES
```

---

## 8. Conclusion

This project showcases efficient image processing in C++ with multithreading and clean documentation. It also serves as a template for further GPU-based or SIMD-optimized processing in the future.
